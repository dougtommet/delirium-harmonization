# delirium-harmonization

NIDUS Delirium harmonization project

This projects harmonizes the delirium measures in SAGES to the delirium measures in the Duke studies.  
The cognition harmonization part of this project is in this repo: https://github.com/dougtommet/gcp-harmonization

This project should not be confused with the other SAGES delirium harmonization project (with a similar name) where we harmonized the CAM-S, MDAS, and DRS-R98.
That project is in this repo: https://github.com/dougtommet/DeliriumHarmonization
